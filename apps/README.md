# Apps

Apps join the code in [`packages/`](../packages/) & [`shared/`](../shared/) into installable applications. These apps could be built into distributables, released to pypi, etc.

Where `packages` are meant to be a self-contained logical grouping of code for a specific task, and `shared` is for global utilities & services, `apps` are the joined functionality of the code written throughout the repository.
